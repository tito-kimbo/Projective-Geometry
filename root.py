INSTRUCTIONS
Open Sage console (through icon in Windows, through the command 'sage --sh' in Linux).
Move console to the directory where this file is stored (through 'cd DIRECTORY').
Open console python interpreter ('python' command).
Write: 'from root import *'.
All of the commands of this library should be available now for usage within the console.
